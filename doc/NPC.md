Welcome stranger. Nice to see you here.
Let me introduce myself, I'm the TooAngel NPC a [community driven](https://www.worlddriven.org) account. If you like to get in contact with makers head over to [discord](https://discord.com/channels/860665589738635336/931237079315251280).

## Reputation

From here on you can decide how to interact with the TooAngel NPC, based on your actions you can build up or decrease your reputation.

I don't like:

- Hostile creeps into my rooms
- Destroying structures of even spawns
- Sending nukes

I like:

- Sending resources via terminal
- Solving [Quests](Quests.md)

Based on the level of reputation certain actions will be performed, like:

### Negative

- Be annoying in your reserved rooms
- Attacking your rooms
- Sending nukes

### Positive

- Your creeps are seen as friends in the open areas
- Sharing, instead of defending, resources like power
- Open to accept quests from you

## Basic behavior

- I keep a safety radius of 1 linear distance around the rooms and attack other controlled or reserved rooms
- Hostile actions are retaliated
- I like my rooms, if attacked or destroyed, I'll try the best to keep them, even after loosing the last spawn.
