# TooAngel NPC

Welcome stranger. Nice to see you here.
Let me introduce myself, I'm the TooAngel NPC a [community driven](https://www.worlddriven.org) account. If you like to contact with makers head over to [discord](https://discord.com/channels/860665589738635336/931237079315251280).

## Reputation

From here on you can decide how to interact with the TooAngel NPC, based on your actions you can build up or decrease your reputation.

I don't like:

- Send creeps into my rooms
- Destroying structures of even spawns
- Sending nukes

I like:

- Sending resources via terminal
- Solving [Quests](Quests.md)

Based on the level of reputation certain actions will be performed, like:

### Negative

- Be annoying in your reserved rooms
- Attacking your rooms
- Sending nukes

### Positive

- Your creeps are seen as friends in the open areas
- Sharing, instead of defending, resources like power
- Open to accept quests from you

## Basic behavior

- I want to make sure that you are prepared for the dangers out there. On the first meetings I'll make sure that your room defense is up for a minimal standard.

See it as a:

"It is most gratifying that your enthusiasm for our planet continues unabated.
As a token of our appreciation, we hope you will enjoy the two thermonuclear
missiles we've just sent to converge with your craft. To ensure ongoing quality
of service, your death may be monitored for training purposes. Thank you."
(The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy)


- There is a radius around my rooms which I see as mine, all interactions there are considered hostile and I'll react appropiate.


- I like my rooms, if attacked or destroyed, I'll try my best to keep them, even after loosing the last spawn.

## API

- Sending resources via terminal will increase the credit value of the resources to the `reputation`
- Segements 1, 2 are public and show the Top and Bottom players based on their `reputation`
