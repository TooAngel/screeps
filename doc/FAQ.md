# FAQ

## What does the random words mean the creep at the controller is shouting?

The controller creep spits out the friendly "Don't like" list. If you are on
the list the AI considers you as unfriendly und will you treat like this.

## How can I get off the "Don't like" list?

If you transfer resources to one of my terminals, the idiot value will be
decreased. You can see the value shouted out as credits and the calculation is based
on the market price of the resources you send.

## Why am I being attacked without being on the list

On the first contact I would like to make sure that your defense is strong
enough for this area. See it as a:

"It is most gratifying that your enthusiasm for our planet continues unabated.
As a token of our appreciation, we hope you will enjoy the two thermonuclear
missiles we've just sent to converge with your craft. To ensure ongoing quality
of service, your death may be monitored for training purposes. Thank you."
(The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy)

On a private server with multiple bots, this mechanism makes sure that the
tension between these bots start.

Or it is a bug.

## Why am I on the "Don't like" list / How can I get on the list?

There are rules.

Think of what you consider as aggresion, this will raise your value. In case
you are doing something which you would consider as aggression but your value
doesn't increase, contact me.

## Why am I being attacked, while on the list?

You deserve it.

## Are you, TooAngel, active playing this game?

This depends on how you define 'active playing'.

I see it as having multiple development environments (a couple of my private
server, some other private server, live, ptr). Depending on the current
topic I'm using the environment which fits best.

To test different scenarios I trigger actions manually, like injecting some
creeps into the queue, to develop the behavior and afterwards the trigger
for injecting.

If your questions is if I triggered the attack against you:
The answer is usually no.

## Why are your rooms on live behaving so shitty?

My code and my AI are shit. The last time I were mainly working on the bot
and on private servers, to make sure the first RCLs work out somehow.
Having a GCL 20+ is in many regards different to a GCL 1.

## Why did you made your AI open source?

 - I wanted to deploy my AI on random private servers where my code is not as
   private as before.
 - Playing against myself is a funny idea, so releasing it as a bot allows it
 - In diplomatic conversation I was telling people 'My AI is doing this or that',
   have it public will underline that statement.
