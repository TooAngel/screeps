# Diplomacy

A `reputation` is stored for other players. The `reputation` is influenced by certain actions, like attacking, visiting rooms, solving quest or transferring resources.

Based on the `reputation` the behavior of the NPC changes.
Positive `reputation` means friendly player, not considering creeps as hostile creeps, sharing resources and execute quests on demand.
Negative `reputation` lead to hostile behavior and different levels of attacks.
