# Testing

### if you want to test in a local environment:
 - create a .env file in root see .env.example
 
### Following tests are automatically executed on a new PR and new commits on master:
 - Checking Code style
 - Starting a private server and checking for controller upgrade with a certain time.

Unit tests would be nice.
