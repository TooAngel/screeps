# Mineral handling

The room mineral is harvested and stored in the terminal up 500k, all other minerals are stored up to 1k.
Other base minerals are requested via terminal transfer from other rooms.
All minerals are reacted to the most advanced version.

Minerals beyond that threshold are sold in the market.

A mineral creep is responsible for filling up the labs.

On creep spawn boosts are requested, after the spawn the creep moves to the lab and gets boosted.
