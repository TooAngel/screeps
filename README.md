Nowadays there are a couple of other automated screeps bot around. The
TooAngel bot layed the groundwork for bots on the private server and the full
automation idea. It was the first full automated open source code base and
invented the idea of an community driven merge processes as well as a full
automated bot deploy process. This was copied by other screeps projects like Quorum.

Pull Requests are automatically merged ([World Driven](https://www.worlddriven.org)) and deployed to the
[Screeps TooAngel account](https://www.screeps.com).

## Info

This is the AI I'm using for screeps. I managed to reach Top 10
from November 2015 - March 2016. Main Goal is to automate everything, no
manual interaction needed.

The AI is deployable on a private screeps server, follow the information on
[Steam](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=800902233) or
`npm install screeps-bot-tooangel` and `bots.spawn('screeps-bot-tooangel', ROOMNAME)`

## Note

This is not a good example for code quality or structure, most LOCs written
while fighting or other occasions which needed quick fixes or in the ingame
editor (getting better :-)). But I think there are a couple of funny ideas.
Every contribution is welcome.

## Features

 - [Automatic Base building](doc/BaseBuilding.md)
 - External room harvesting
 - Basic mineral handling
 - Power harvesting
 - New rooms claiming on GCL level up
 - Automatic attack
 - Rebuild of fallen rooms
 - [Layout visualization](doc/Visualization.md)
 - [Manual commands](doc/Manual.md)
 - [Graphs](doc/Graphs.md)
 - [Testing](doc/Testing.md)

## Tweaking

Add a `src/friends.js` with player names to ignore them from all attack
considerations.

E.g.:
`module.exports = ['TooAngel'];`


Add a `src/config_local.js` to overwrite configuration values. Copy
`config_local.js.example` to `src/config_local.js` as an example. `src/config.js`
has the default values.

## Debugging

Within the `config_local.js` certain `config.debug` flags can be enabled.
To add debug messages `Room.debugLog(TYPE, MESSAGE)` and
`Creep.creepLog(MESSAGE)` are suggested. Especially the `creepLog` allows
granular output of the creep behavior based on the room and the creep role.

## Upload

install dependencies

    npm install

add your account credentials

### to screeps.com

To deploy to the live server provide the credentials.

#### via env

    export email=EMAIL
    export password=PASSWORD

#### via git ignored file

    echo "module.exports = { email: 'your-email@here.tld', password: 'your-secret' };" > account.screeps.com.js
 or edit and rename account.screeps.com.js.sample to account.screeps.com.js   

And deploy to the server:

    grunt

### to private server
Create a `.localSync.js` file with content:
```
module.exports = [{
  cwd: 'src',
  src: [
    '*.js'
  ],
  dest: '$HOME/.config/Screeps/scripts/SERVER/default',
}];
```

    grunt local


## Develop

    grunt dev

## Release

Releasing to npm is done automatically by increasing the version and merging to `master`.

    npm version 10.0.1
    git push --follow-tags

Every deploy to `master` is automatically deployed to the live tooangel account.

## Testing

`node utils/test.js` will start a private server and add some bots as test
cases. Within in the `tmp-test-server` directory the server can be easily
started via `screeps start`.
