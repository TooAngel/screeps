# How to contribute

All kind of contribution is welcome, issues, contact via channels, pull requests.

This repository uses
[world driven](https://www.worlddriven.org/)
for automatic merging.

Pull requests needs to be send to the master, all checks needs to be good green.
The automatic merge is time based depending on github review workflow outcome.

 - `Request changes` reduces the outcome.
 - `Approve` increases the outcome

 The weight of each review if based on the number of commits of the reviewer.
 If the outcome is negative the merge will not happen. Higher positive outcome
 will decrease the time to merge.

 Start joining this project, be part of it, if you like - anyway have fun ;-)
